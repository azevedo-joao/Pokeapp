## About
Pokéapp is an iOS project for learning purposes. The app is written in SwiftUI and uses data from the [Pokéapi](https://pokeapi.co "Pokéapi website") API to display various data from a chosen pokémon, i. d. a simple Pokédex. Since all data are fetched from the API, the app will only work with an internet connection.
